Approach to a situation.
 Six principles of the hacker mindset:
 1. Be on offense - being proactive and ensuring that you are the one making the decisions
 2. Reverse engineering - looking at the situation from all the different angles and determine the various options available to you beyond the most obvious ones
 3. Live off the land - taking advantage of freely available resources to maximize your chances of success
 4. Risk - reviewing all the options and factors and determining what will be most likely to get you what you want with as little cost and effort as possible
 5. Social engineering - making use of people to achieve your goal
 6. Pivot - approaching the problem from different angles and reacting to the changing factors in the scenario
