Possible candidates for the future home lab server:

- FreeBSD - used for virtualization due to its stability, performance, and advanced feature like ZFS and jails.
- Arch Linux - requeires careful management to ensure stability
- NixOS - if you value reproducibility
- Void Linux - lightweight system with rolling releases
- OpenBSD - hardware limitations, not the best performance


FreeBSD seems like a good start for me.
